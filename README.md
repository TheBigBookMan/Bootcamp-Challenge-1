# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Introduction
Within this repository, I was able to refactor the given code for the Horiseon home page. 

## General Changes
There was a change from elements to semantic structuring to ensure a greater flow and easier understanding of the projects code. These included: Header, Navigation, Figure, Section, Article, Aside and Footer.

I was then able to add in relatable and easy to understand ALT descriptions for the images that were previously selected for the website.

While adding in these parts for the project, I was making sure that the elements were in a sequential order.

I was then able to create a similar structural flow of CSS elements to allow for more organised code.

Further comments were created on HTML and CSS files to ensure that the readers were aware of any changes and specific coding parts to what they were doing in the live webpage.
